\section{Case Study: Power Savings of UI design}
\label{sec:caseui}

% Messaging apps
% Pandora vs. Spotify
% Facebook vs. Facebook lite

We investigate how the UI design affects the OLED power consumption. We found
that the UI deign contributes to overall the efficiency of the app.

We divide the apps in \dcomment{4} categories according to the content and 
services provided by them. In each category we choose two apps which grossly
different UI designs. We mainly focus on the UI design being light and dark,
and with graphics.

The results are provided by the table\ref{tab:category_app_comparison}
\begin{table}[]
	\centering
	\caption{App Comparison}
	\begin{tabular*}{\columnwidth}{ | l | r | l | r | }
		\hline
		App1 Name & Display Current & App2 Name & Display Current \\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular*}
	\label{tab:category_app_comparison}
\end{table}


From the results we conclude that the UI design is a major factor which can
seriously affect the battery live of a device.
